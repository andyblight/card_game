# card_game
This repo contains an implementation of a card game using Python 3.  

## Objectives
1. Develop playable application for card games. 110 to start with.  Eventually, the application should:
 - have a client/server architecture.   The server implements the game rules and the clients display the data sent from the server.
 - have clients that are Qt applications or are browser based (both would be ideal but one will do for now). 
 - have "AI" clients to replace real players.  These clients would run on the same PC as the server. 
2. Develop re-usable core module(s) for playing other card games.  Card games to consider implementing in the future are: 
 - Cribbage.
 - A two pack patience game (whose name I can't remember). 

## Current status - 16 August 2015
The implementation of the card game 110 is nearly complete as a command line application.  This has allowed me to develop the core elements required for game play.
