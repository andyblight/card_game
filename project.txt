PLAN
====
1. Develop the game from the command line.
2. Create minimal client command line app to send JSON commands 
   to the server and receive and display the replies. 
3. Choose a GUI to use. 
   Pyjs was looking promising until I tried to use it.  Only supports Python2 so no use.
   Going for PySide instead as it is a Qt wrapper, supports Python3 and is easy to install.   
4. Create a GUI using the new framework.  


TODO
====
Add more rules about bidding.

If a player leads with the Joker, there is no suit set so any card can be laid.
This works already as no one else will be able to follow suit. 

Add "The suit to follow is" message to each player.

The winner of the round should lead the next round. 
Next round does not start properly.
